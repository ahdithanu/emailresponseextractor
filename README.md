# 📧 Email Response Extractor

A powerful web-based tool that automatically extracts contact information from email campaign responses across multiple CSV files. Perfect for sales teams who need to quickly identify and follow up with leads who have responded to email outreach campaigns.

🎯 Problem Solved
Email campaigns generate hundreds or thousands of responses (including bouncebacks, out-of-office replies, and actual responses). Manually sorting through these to extract follow-up leads is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates the entire process.

✨ Features
Multi-file Processing: Upload and process multiple CSV files simultaneously
Smart Filtering: Automatically excludes explicit "don't contact" requests while including all other responses
Contact Extraction: Parses names, extracts company info from email domains, finds phone numbers in replies
Real-time Statistics: Live dashboard showing total responses, follow-up leads, and excluded contacts
Instant Export: Download clean CSV with all follow-up leads ready for CRM import
No Installation Required: Pure HTML/JavaScript - runs in any modern browser
